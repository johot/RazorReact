Why not ReactJS.NET?
--------------------

* Bigger project with more clashing dependencies
* Requires WebActivatorEx which we can't get working in our old solution
* No built in caching (as far as I can tell)
* More complex to set up and use
* Bad docs
* Doesn't seem to support using multiple bundles for differents "apps" (major problem)
